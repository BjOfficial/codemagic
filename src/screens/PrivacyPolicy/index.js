            the details of these are entered in Azzetta to help you to get

            ratings provided by you to your network for helping others in your
            network to make informed decisions. Azzetta covers Home and Kitchen
            Appliances, Electronic Gadgets, as major categories. However there
            is an option for users to put all other equipments, professional
            tools, factory machinery or tools/ jigs etc including 2 or 4
            wheelers, cycles, etc., under the category called in Azzetta as
            “Others”.{"\n"}
            {"\n"} Azzetta Application will collect, and store all product
            related information. This includes, but is not limited to Brand,
            Type or category of product, photos or uploaded documents like
            invoice, warranty cards, AMC contracts, extended warranty documents.
            We prefer all these are actually stored in DigiLocker so that
            Azzetta is a light weight application storing very limited user data
            as absolutely required as there are so many Apps that are downloaded
            and dumped / deleted due to storage limitations of the cell phone.

            set due dates, purchase dates, amounts etc that is sufficient to
            make the best use of Azzetta features. This also helps to keep

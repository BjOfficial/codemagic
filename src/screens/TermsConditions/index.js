								2. How Azzetta Works{' '}
							</Text>
							{'\n'}
							{'\n'}
							Once the Azzetta App is installed on your mobile you are required
							to choose your primary location. Then you can enter the basic
							appliance details like Brand, Model and purchase date or month as
							available. If you have the invoice with serial number and the
							warranty period of the appliance / gadget then you can update them
							at the stage of initial onboarding or later through the edit
							option. You can also choose the location within your residence as
							some appliances like AC are there in multiple rooms. Whenever you
							undertake any repair or service to any appliance you should fill
							in details of the repair/service along with the cost of
							repair/service in the App. You may upload a scanned copy of the
							invoice/bill in the App. After this you will be able to view a
							dashboard of all your appliances, their location, the warranty
							dates, repairs/services done and the cost of ownership of each
							appliance.{'\n'}
							{'\n'} In case of documents, you are required to fill in the
							important information like renewal date, payment date, due date,
							etc., and the place where each document is kept. You should set up
							alerts to remind you about renewals, payments and reminders
							related to your documents (that you might have stored in
							DigiLocker) such as Passports, Visas, Driving License, Insurance,
							etc. {'\n'}
